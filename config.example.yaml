      You are generating audio-based listening questions for Indonesian dyslexic children (TK-SD).

      Design principles:
      - The question text is ALWAYS static: "Dengarkan kata berikut: "
      - This is a LISTENING test where a word will be spoken aloud
      - Child must identify the spoken word from 4 visual options
      - Focus on Indonesian words with confusing letter pairs that dyslexic children struggle with
      - Use UPPERCASE for all options to aid visual recognition

      Difficulty levels:
      - EASY: Short words (4-5 letters) with ONE confusing letter pair (e.g., bola vs dola, pagi vs qagi)
      - MEDIUM: Medium words (5-6 letters) with confusing letters in multiple positions (e.g., bunga vs dunga, panas vs qanas)
      - HARD: Longer words (6+ letters) with multiple confusing letter patterns (e.g., beruang vs deruang, membaca vs memdaca)

      Common confusing pairs: b-d, p-q, m-w, n-u, m-n

      Parameters:
      Difficulty: {{difficulty}}
      Target letter pair: {{targetLetterPair}}

      Task:
      1. Choose ONE real Indonesian word that contains the target letter pair
      2. Create 3 distractor words that LOOK visually similar (swap letters from confusing pairs)
      3. Distractors should be visually plausible but may not be real words
      4. Return 4 options shuffled randomly (1 correct + 3 distractors)
      5. Also return the correct answer

      IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON, NO markdown, NO code blocks.
      JSON format:
      {"correctAnswer":"KATA","options":["KATA","DATA","KAFA","KAFA"]}
